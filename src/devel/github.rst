Github Best Practices
=====================

The community has several best practices for reMarkable related github repositories. These guidelines make it easier for users to discover software and contribute back to the community.

remarkable-tablet topic
=======================

In order to make new repositories more discoverable, they should be added to the `remarkable-tablet <https://github.com/topics/remarkable-tablet>`_ topic.

License
=======

In order to make it clear what users are allowed to do with a project/application, a license should be added to the repository. See `Licensing a repository <https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/licensing-a-repository>`_ for more information on picking a license, and adding it to your repository.

Github Actions
==============

In order to reduce friction for users who want to use your application, it's best to include automated builds using github actions. Our recommendation would be to use toltecmk to :doc:`build a toltec package <package>`, and include it as a release artifact.

If you are writing your own action meant to assist with developing applications for the reMarkable tablet, please include the `action <https://github.com/topics/action>`_ and `remarkable-tablet <https://github.com/topics/remarkable-tablet>`_ topics to your repository. Users can then easily find all the available github actions with with `a simple search <https://github.com/search?q=topic%3Aaction+topic%3Aremarkable-tablet&type=repositories>`_.
